**Summarizer** is a web app made for hackMIT 2014 by [Neel Mehta](github.com/hathix) and [Felix Zhu](github.com/felixzhuologist).

It finds the key terms of a reading and lets you see information about those terms at a glance. Or, read the text with helpful clarifications along the way.
Just paste the relevant text or upload a file containing the reading on the home page.
